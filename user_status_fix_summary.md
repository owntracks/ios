# User Status Fix Implementation

## Problem Identified

The OwnTracks iOS app was **not publishing `user_status` with `active: false`** when the app went to background or was terminated. This meant that other devices/clients would continue to see the user as "active" even when they weren't using the app.

## Root Cause

The `publishStatus` method in `OwnTracking.m` had a critical limitation:

```objective-c
- (void)publishStatus:(BOOL)isActive {
    // Only publish user_status when app is in foreground
    UIApplicationState appState = [UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationState;
    if (appState != UIApplicationStateActive) {
        DDLogInfo(@"[OwnTracking] Skipping publishStatus: app not in foreground (state: %ld)", (long)appState);
        return;  // üö® This prevented publishing when app goes background/terminates!
    }
    // ... rest of method
}
```

## Solution Implemented

**Option A was chosen** - Add `publishStatus:NO` calls to app lifecycle methods before the app state changes.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `applicationWillResignActive` (Line 304)
```objective-c
- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    DDLogInfo(@"[OwnTracksAppDelegate] applicationWillResignActive");
    [[OwnTracking sharedInstance] publishStatus:NO];  // ‚Üê Added this line
}
```

#### 2. `applicationWillTerminate` (Line 323)
```objective-c
- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:YES forKey:@"wasTerminated"];
    DDLogWarn(@"[OwnTracksAppDelegate] applicationWillTerminate Set Bool");
    
    // Publish inactive status before disconnecting  // ‚Üê Added this comment
    [[OwnTracking sharedInstance] publishStatus:NO];  // ‚Üê Added this line
    
    [self background];
    [self.connection disconnect];
    // ... rest of method
}
```

## Why This Solution is Optimal

### ‚úÖ **Most Reliable**
- `applicationWillResignActive` is called BEFORE the app state changes
- App is still `UIApplicationStateActive` when we call `publishStatus:NO`
- Existing `publishStatus` logic works perfectly without modification

### ‚úÖ **Least Intrusive**
- Only adds 2 lines of code to existing lifecycle methods
- No changes to core `publishStatus` logic
- No new methods or complex modifications

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Backgrounding**: `applicationWillResignActive` catches all background transitions
- **Termination**: `applicationWillTerminate` ensures status is sent before app closes
- **Edge Cases**: Covers app switching, notification center, home screen, etc.

## Expected Behavior

Now when users:
- Switch to another app
- Pull down notification center  
- Go to home screen
- Force close the app
- App is terminated

The app will reliably publish:
```json
{
  "_type": "user_status",
  "tid": "device_id", 
  "active": false,
  "tst": 1720780800
}
```

## Testing

The implementation compiles successfully and is ready for testing. The fix ensures that other OwnTracks clients will properly see when a user is no longer actively using the app.
